# AutoGrow Mobile App
The AutoGrow Mobile App is a mobile application that allows users to remotely manage a cultivation tent. The app is designed to simplify the crop management process, enabling users to monitor and control their cultivation systems from anywhere using their mobile device.

## Main features:
1. **Login to protected areas of the application**: The app includes an authentication system that protects access to management and monitoring functions. Users must log in to access their cultivation systems.
2. **Display of assigned hubs**: Users can view a list of hubs that are assigned to their account. A hub is a device that controls various aspects of the cultivation system, such as lighting, irrigation, and temperature control.
3. **Addition of a new hub via QR code scanning**: The app allows users to add new hubs to their system by scanning a QR code. This simplifies the setup process and eliminates the need for manual data entry.
4. **Detailed view for the selected hub**: Upon selecting a hub from the list, users can view detailed information about the hub, including the status of individual modules and current conditions in the cultivation system.
5. **Capability to control hub modules**: Users can remotely control the modules in each hub, allowing them to precisely adjust the conditions in the cultivation system.

In the future, automatic crop planning functionality is planned to be added, which will assist users in optimizing their cultivation processes.

The AutoGrow Mobile App is a tool that can significantly simplify the management of cultivation systems, enabling users to monitor and control their crops from anywhere
